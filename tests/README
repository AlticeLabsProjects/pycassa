To run the tests:
1. Install python-nose (http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/)
2. Move the log4j.properties and storage-conf.xml to your Cassandra conf directory
3. Run nosetests in the top directory

Because of the way timestamps work in Cassandra and are used in the unit tests,
nosetests will fail if run in quick succession. Give it 10 seconds or so before
running it again.
